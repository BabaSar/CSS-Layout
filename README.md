Basics of CSS Layout

LAYOUT WRAPPER
-A wrapper (also referred to as container) is used to enclose your layout within boundaries, and centers it on the page. With a wrapper, you can control the width of the layout.
-You can use div elements as wrappers, so you can have segments within the body and not outside of it. Divs are used to subdivide the elements within the body.

MEDIA QUERIES
-Any rule written inside a media query is specific to a certain screen/device size.
-Any rule written outside of a media query is shared by all screens/devices.
