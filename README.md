Basics of CSS Layout

LAYOUT WRAPPER
-A wrapper (also referred to as container) is used to enclose your layout within boundaries, and centers it on the page. With a wrapper, you can control the width of the layout.
-You can use div elements as wrappers, so you can have segments within the body and not outside of it. Divs are used to subdivide the elements within the body.
